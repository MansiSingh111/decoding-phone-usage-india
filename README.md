# 📱 Clustering & Exploratory Data Analysis: Phone Usage Patterns

Welcome! This repository showcases unsupervised machine learning and exploratory data analysis on a phone usage dataset. By applying K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models, the project identifies distinct user groups, visualizes clustering results, and interprets behavioral traits using Python.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed diverse phone usage data
- Multiple clustering algorithms implemented (K-Means, GMM)
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA for clear visualizations
- Cluster membership assignment and profiling
- Feature-wise distribution analysis per cluster
- Professional Streamlit UI for seamless interactive exploration
